## Version 2.0 
#### Inventory
View the latest major update, version 2.0, introduces a new inventory view that displays
all collected items after using the `/result` command.


Additionally, a new end-of-session animation has been added.

### How to Play
You follow a **specific, unique** order when searching for the required items. 
Ensure you have a Spigot Server with Minecraft version 1.20.1 and download the
`.jar` file before dragging it into the **plugins folder**.
(Please note that currently, it is based on the player's name and **not** dynamic.)

### Commands to Start and Get Results

To **start** the game, enter the command `/start <time> <jokers>` in the chat.

To obtain the **results** of the game in ascending order, enter the command `/result`.

Here are some additional commands you might find useful.
Save your current position to return later or recall them:
`/pos <name>`

### Experimental Features
(v1.4-beta) **USE v1.5
INSTEAD** The pre-release version is very stable, but sometimes the jokers don't work properly. It always works whether looking skyward or gazing at a block.
