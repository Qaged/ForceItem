### How to play
Try to find the requested items in a specific, unique order. 
Make sure you have a **spigot server** with the minecraft version 1.20.1. Download the `.jar` file and drag it into the **plugins folder**.
(Currently it is player name based and **NOT** dynamic)

### Commands
**Start** the game in the minecraft chat:
`/start <time> <jokers>`

Get the endgame **results**, ordered from least to most:
`/result`

### Additional Commands
Save your current position to return later or recall them:
`/pos <name>`

### Experimental Features (v1.4-beta)
**USE v1.5 INSTEAD**
The current pre-release version is very stable, but sometimes the jokers don't work properly. It always works either looking in the air or looking on a block.
